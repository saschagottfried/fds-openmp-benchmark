# fds-openmp-benchmark

Answer the question on OpenMP speedup in any custom environment. This project is inspired by [OpenMP benchmark conducted by Thunderhead Engineering in 08/2014](http://www.thunderheadeng.com/2014/08/openmp-benchmarks/). Based on the assumption that the initial answer depends on lots of circumstances people want to re-run this benchmark when newer FDS version were released.
